Using Data Analytics on Healthcare Claims Data

Hundreds of medical research studies have been published during
the past 25 years have relied on claims data. Claims data,
also called billing or sometimes administrative data, have
been used to study such diverse issues as the use of
comorbidity indices to predict the risk of death, antiretroviral
therapy, psychotropic drug usage, children’s mental
health services, substance use disorders, and the cost
effectiveness of lung-volume–reduction surgery, diabetes
preventive services, and numerous other areas.
Most recently, they have been used as data by health and life
insurance companies to reach decisions about whether to
cover specific individuals.
 Claims databases, simply put, are electronic records of
millions of transactions that are purported to have occurred
between patients and healthcare providers. They include
information entered on bills (claims) submitted by hospitals,
clinics, nursing homes, pharmacies, individual providers, and
other medical professionals to the public (e.g., Medicare and
Medicaid) and private (e.g., Blue Cross/Blue Shield)
insurance entities. The frequency and growth of such studies
may impact healthcare policies that rely on them. Claims
Data may provide useful information, but they are not perfect
and the extent of weaknesses inherent in them brings into
question the validity of some studies that utilize them.

We created healthcare categories in which to sort the
different studies to determine if specific data sources
were associated with certain topics. We categorized the
studies as: access to healthcare, prevention and
detection of disease, quality of healthcare, morbidity
and mortality, and interventions, therapies, and
treatments. These are broad categories and may have
overlapping characteristics. They are meant to create a
general picture of the studies that utilized claims data.

We have used two different fields, for eg, Obstetrics and Gynaecology as OBGYN into one file
and perform all the necessary insights, such as

Merging and transforming complex claims datasets for unified analysis

Higher-level categorization of medical procedures and billing codes

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, gaps, and anomalies

ETL operations using SQL in BigQuery to extract and manage large-scale data from a healthcare data warehouse

Process Mining with Celonis to understand patient claim journeys and detect bottlenecks

Leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models) to enhance data understanding and assist in insight generation

Predictive analytics to anticipate consumption events and possible outcomes

Irregularity detection and fraud risk assessment using anomaly detection techniques

Performance tracking by comparing actual vs. defined KPIs
